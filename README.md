# üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ethers-ozrelayer-middleware

Implements a custom middleware for [ethers-rs](https://github.com/gakonst/ethers-rs) to send transactions through [OpenZeppelin Relayer](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/defender/relay).
It's using [cognito-srp-auth](https://github.com/lucdew/cognito-srp-auth) for cognito authentication under the hood.

Access tokens are stored in memory and refreshed when expired.
